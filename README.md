# Heuristic Algorithms for the Stochastic Critical Node Detection Problem

This repository contains the source code accompanying the paper  
**“Heuristic Algorithms for the Stochastic Critical Node Detection Problem.”**

It includes implementation of the **Rounding the Expected Graph Algorithm (REGA)** from **"Dinh T. N, and Thai. M. T (2015) Assessing attack vulnerability in networks with uncertainty. INFOCOM"** and our proposed **Greedy with Maximal Independent Set (MIS)** heuristic.  
All experiments were conducted on **Ubuntu** using **Python 3.12**.

```

## Setup

To use the code, first clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuguldur102/StochasticCNDP.git
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv env
```

To activate the virtual environment

On Windows:
```bash
venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

or 

on Ubuntu:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Experiments

The repository provides two benchmark scripts corresponding to the edge probability settings used in the paper:

- Uniform probability setting:
```bash
python uniform_benchmark.py
```

- Heterogeneous probability setting:
```bash
python heterogeneous_benchmark.py
```

Each script performs benchmark comparisons on 100-node graphs with a deletion budget K = 10.
After execution, results are automatically saved as CSV files in the project root directory.
